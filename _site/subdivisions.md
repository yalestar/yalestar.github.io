This was one of my first projects when I was first learning web development in about 2004. Setting up PHP and MySQL and Apache on Windows is kind of a bittersweet memory from those times. Sure, it would've been way easier to do it all on the client side, but I was so determined to figure out how to get my WAMP on.

By the way, my all-time favorite real-life subdivision name... actually there are two, and they're both in the Denver metro area: the first is **SkyRidge at RidgeGate**. Zing! And there's that NewEconomy spelling we like so much. The second is **The Hermitage**. Hermitage is a type of wine, which is a dumb enough name for a subdivision, but its synonym, a dwelling for hermits, yields the greatest irony. More recently I've started to notice that the peddlers of such dream homes have run out of combinations using idyllic and pastoral words, and so some of the newer subdivisions have even stupider names, cheap sentimental shit like "Inspiration" or "Homecoming."
