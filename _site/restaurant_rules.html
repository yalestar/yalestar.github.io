<h3 id="restaurant-rules">Restaurant Rules</h3>

<p>As indicated elsewhere, I <em>love</em> eating in restaurants. Just love it. And while I would never deign to refer to myself as a <em>foodie</em> (I hold every type of restaurant in similar regard, be it hipster dining or shitball joints like Famous Dave’s), I have developed what I think is a novel set of</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Background Music</strong>: this one is extremely important to me, not only as a card-carrying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misophonia">Misophonia</a> sufferer, but as a citizen. A quiet restaurant is DEATH, and every restaurateur worth their salt already knows this. Unfortunately it’s still fairly common to visit a place where either the proprietor or the staff haven’t gotten the memo yet. Again, as a misohpone I realize that mine is an extreme case, but there is almost nothing more agonizing and anxiety-inducing than eating in a restaurant where people have to whisper and all you hear is the clinking of silverware on plates. Visit any Shari’s in metro Portland (or whatever the equivalent surf-n-turf/pie chain is in your area) and you’ll experience this.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now having said all of the foregoing, I must also add that the music can also be too loud! There’s a fairly narrow window of acceptable music volume that –again– most places have gotten wise to. But often a restaurant (<em>–ahem– Little Big Burger</em>) either hasn’t figured this out, or (more likely) has some rogue employees that crank shit up to deafening volumes. I get it: as a lifelong unrepenant music snob, I too feel that need to bombard others with my superior musical tastes. But once you’ve learned that</p>
