<h3 id="restaurant-writin">Restaurant Writin’</h3>

<p>Whoo-ee, I sure do love to go out to restaurants. Portland has recently become kind of a culinary hub in the past 10-15 years, but not in the high-end style of cuisine that you’d see in NYC or LA or SF. I’ve heard it described as “Stoner Cuisine” a few times, and that’s a pretty apt descriptor for the types of things you see here.</p>

<p>Like most things, this Portland culinary resurgence started out rather organically, and then THE MAN got a whiff of money and got his grubby mitts all over everything. Now you see quite a few local restaurants that are clearly the product of corporate restaurant development groups that come up with concepts. One place in particular is Shalom Y’all, which, –it must be said– had good food, but it definitely reeked of corporate concept dining: <em>What if we juxtaposed traditional Israeli street food with a no-frills laid-back west coast flair?</em> Barf.</p>

<p>I have this fantasy of one day opening up a really expensive restaurant where one of the dishes is called FUCK YOU, and it costs $120. It’s nothing more than a tiny plate with “Fuck You” drizzled on it in raspberry compote, and a sprig of parsley.</p>
