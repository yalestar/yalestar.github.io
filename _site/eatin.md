### Restaurant Writin'

Whoo-ee, I sure do love to go out to restaurants. Portland has recently become kind of a culinary hub in the past 10-15 years, but not in the high-end style of cuisine that you'd see in NYC or LA or SF. I've heard it described as "Stoner Cuisine" a few times, and that's a pretty apt descriptor for the types of things you see here. 

Like most things, this Portland culinary resurgence started out rather organically, and then THE MAN got a whiff of money and got his grubby mitts all over everything. Now you see quite a few local restaurants that are clearly the product of corporate restaurant development groups that come up with concepts. One place in particular is Shalom Y'all, which, --it must be said-- had good food, but it definitely reeked of corporate concept dining: _What if we juxtaposed traditional Israeli street food with a no-frills laid-back west coast flair?_ Barf.

I have this fantasy of one day opening up a really expensive restaurant where one of the dishes is called FUCK YOU, and it costs $120. It's nothing more than a tiny plate with "Fuck You" drizzled on it in raspberry compote, and a sprig of parsley.
