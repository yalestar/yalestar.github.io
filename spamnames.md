### Spam Names

<style type="text/css">
  #spam_name {
    font-size: 30px;
    padding-top: 10px;
    padding-bottom: 15px;
  }
</style>
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.min.js"></script>
<script src="/spamnames.js"></script>

About 20 years ago my Yahoo Mail account used to get several spam messages a day from these odd names. They were obviously generated by a script but they were so reliably hilarious that I started collecting them, and now I have about 4500 of them.
