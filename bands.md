### List of Life-Changing Bands

These bands/artists have all had a hella, hella profound impact on me from about age 12 to the present.

You'll probably see this list and be like, "Wow, did you completely stop listening to music in 1998 or something?" Well, not really. But I definitely stopped being deeply invested in discovering new music at a certain point. And also, once I got to my 40s and 50s, new music rarely has a monumental impact on me like it did when I was like age 15-25.
