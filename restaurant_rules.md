### Restaurant Rules

As indicated elsewhere, I _love_ eating in restaurants. Just love it. And while I would never deign to refer to myself as a _foodie_ (I hold every type of restaurant in similar regard, be it hipster dining or shitball joints like Famous Dave's), I have developed what I think is a novel set of 

1. **Background Music**: this one is extremely important to me, not only as a card-carrying [Misophonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misophonia) sufferer, but as a citizen. A quiet restaurant is DEATH, and every restaurateur worth their salt already knows this. Unfortunately it's still fairly common to visit a place where either the proprietor or the staff haven't gotten the memo yet. Again, as a misophone I realize that mine is an extreme case, but there is almost nothing more agonizing and anxiety-inducing than eating in a restaurant where people have to whisper and all you hear is the clinking of silverware on plates. Visit any Shari's in metro Portland (or whatever the equivalent surf-n-turf/pie chain is in your area) and you'll experience this. 

Now having said all of the foregoing, I must also add that the music can also be too loud! There's a fairly narrow window of acceptable music volume that --again-- most places have gotten wise to. But often a restaurant (_--ahem-- Little Big Burger_) either hasn't figured this out, or (more likely) has some rogue employees that crank shit up to deafening volumes. I get it: as a lifelong unrepenant music snob, I too feel that need to bombard others with my superior musical tastes. But, like me, you'll eventually come to terms with the fact that _nobody_ is interested in whatever obscure Moldovan Casio-based polka-metal bullshit you're into, and you'll turn that garbage down. 

2. **No fucking singing or hooting**: you know what I'm talking about. Places where the management forces the staff to yell or sing or ring a bell whenever someone tips or it's a customer's birthday or they ordered some huge steak or whatever. Apparently there are people who _enjoy_ this sort of nonsense. But I'll go out on a limb and assert that 80-90% of us find it not just annoying, but infantilizing, unseemly, obnoxious and cringey. We're embarrassed on behalf of your poor workers who are made to act like clowns or birthday-cake-jumper-outers. I get that you're trying to foster some kind of convivial environment, but it just seems extremely forced. 

3. **Let's Give Up on the Community Seating Dream**: I really love the idea of community tables, but I think it's time we all admit that it's never anything but awkward and a waste of seating space.

4. **Let customers choose how many napkins to use**: There seems to be a trend afoot to give a customer one or two flimsy napkins.
