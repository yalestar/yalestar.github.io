### Current Obsessions as of 5/22/23

1. **Nomeansno drum parts**: Completely fascinating and inscrutable. I've been a NMN fan since 1991, but on this particular kick for about 2 whole months now. John Wright, everybody.
2. **King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard**: Their thrash-metal album from 2019 "Infest the Rat's Nest" is on fleek, or whatever the youngs say. Here's a live version on (the always spectacularly captured) KEXP: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnmFKS2eDBA
3. **Mdou Moctar**: Just when you think nobody will ever do anything new with guitar, here comes this dude from Niger that tickles his guitar in a completely new way. [Check it out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52CZVfiiMpY); he actually tickles the strings!
4. **Succession**: Just like everybody else, I'm obsessed with this TV show, even though I usually don't understand what's going on.
5. **Take Your Shoes Off podcast**: Rick Glassman is all. Fascinating dude. [Check it out](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKtcQ5JGFkgaaLPSILIlV2TzLs_lDI-Zs)
